# Fast-Multipole-Method
A program to study N-Body problem with  O(N) Fast Multipole Method and O(N^2 ) direct sum method.

Fast-Multipole-Method (FMM) [Journal of Computational Physics 73, 325 (1987)] is one of the top 10 algorithms in history.
It provides O(N) copmplexity to solve the interaction between N-Body systems rather than O(N^2) algorithm.

This program implements FNM and direct sum method in C. The program also compares the computational complexity and Flop/s performance of FNM and direct sum method.
