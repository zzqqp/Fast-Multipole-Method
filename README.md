# Fast-Multipole-Method
A program to study N-Body problem with  O(N) Fast Multipole Method and O(N^2 ) direct sum method.

Fast-Multipole-Method (FMM) [Journal of Computational Physics 73, 325 (1987)] is an important methods listed in the top 10 algorithms in history. (IEEE CiSE 2(1), 22 (â€™00))
It provides O(N) copmplexity to solve the interaction in N-Body systems.

This program implements FMM and direct sum method in C. The program also compares the computational complexity and Flop/s performance of FMM and direct sum method.
